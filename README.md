# OfficePythonProgramming
This repository contains five project reports for the modul: 'Office Application Programming'. </br>

The characteristics of the modul are:
    - learn VBA coding
    - learn Python basics

The valuation of the course consist of five individual projects. Every project is based on a indiviual dataset. 

The database for every project task is: 


## First Project: First Touch
*Time Estimated:*   3 to 5 hours    <br>
*Current State:*    completed       <br>
*Actuael Time:*     4.5 h           <br>

Task: <br>
In the first project the student has to unterstand what the dataset is about. Every dataset is related to an article written by authors of FiveThirtyEight.
In this case the article was about the acceptans of Robert Mueller and his work as special counsel in the "Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election".

    1. Analyse and understand the structure and content of a choosen dataset. <br>
    2. Write a short report about the dataset and the article.

In 2016 the American presidental election was the biggest political event. The decision was beetween Donald Trump and his opponent Hillary Clinton. 
During the elecation russian hackers tried to manipulate voters on social platforms to positively effect votes for Donald Trump.<br>

Because of rising Accusations against the manipulation, a special force was formed to investigate this. The head of this special force, was Robert Mueller. 
He was reponsible for this investigation. 

In the related article "Both Parties Think The Mueller Report Was Fair. They Just Completely Disagree On What It Says." written by Dhrumil Mehta discussed the results and reactions of the two parties.
To sum things up, the article shows that, both Republicans and Democrats think the article was fair, but the interpretation is completly different. 
    Republican think, that the report discharge Trump of any responsibility. 
    Democrats think the complete opposite and demand further actions.

This opion formation is also pictured in the given dataset, that was created as part of the article (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mueller-polls). The dataset contains every job approval poll of Robert Mueller between start (2017) and end (2019) in his job as special councel.

Task: <br>

    1. Use your given dataset and create an Entity-Relationship-Model (ERM).
    2. Use the ERM to create an relational SQL-Database.

## Third Project
*Time Estimated:*   ---             <br>
